Hi, You must've heard that the Earth is not in a good state. The Earth is being polluted by humans by a lot, and it'll be very hard to recover the Earth from its current state.
But, it's not impossible, so we can try our best to recover the Earth. So, here are three ways we can try to protect the Earth.
First, we can save energy. Everyone knows that saving energy is necessary to protect the Earth, but most people are lazy to do so. All you need to do is save energy until nuclear fusion is fully developed. Once it's done, producing energy won't produce waste, so you can freely use it afterward.
Second, we can recycle. Koreans are very good at recycling, but it's hard to recycle exactly. Most people don't know every detail about recycling, and neither do I. Therefore, it's best to search for the exact way to recycle something rather than just doing it with your knowledge.
Third, we can spend minimum stuff. Things that pollute the Earth are produced from things we use, so we can try to minimize them. This way, you can reduce trash, and save money at the same time.
We've learned about 3 ways to protect the Earth. Protecting the Earth is not an easy job, and it requires a lot of effort. So, show us your determination and spend effort to protect the Earth for us all, including yourself.
